### Secondary Font

*   **Playfair Display:** This font should be used exclusively to highlight 1 or 2 words within the headline. It should be used in its Regular Italic style.

### Usage

*   Use Regular, Medium and DemiBold fonts in headlines.
*   Use Telefónica Bold in bodycopy for short highlights.
*   Align texts to the left adjusting them to a grid.
*   Center the text in the layout together with the logo.
*   These are the main color options for texts:
    *   Telefónica Blue on white background.
    *   White on Telefónica Blue background.
    *   Grey 9 on white background.
    *   White on Grey 9 background.

## Layout

*   The layout is based on the concept of circles.
*   Create the margins of the piece dividing the smallest side by 16.
*   From the margin, calculate a grid on which to place the elements in an orderly manner.
*   The combination of circles and functional boxes offers a wide variety of formats.
*   Use circles as a photographic mask, as a text container, or as a mask for images.
*   The use of circles should be sophisticated, conveying simplicity.
